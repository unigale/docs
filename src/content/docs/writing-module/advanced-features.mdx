Epsicube exposes several advanced utilities for module developers through the
`Epsicube\Support\Facades\Epsicube` facade.

## Register a long-running work command

If your module requires a persistent background process, you can register it, see [Manage processes](/usage/manage-processes/):

```php
use Epsicube\Support\Facades\Epsicube;

class YourModule extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Epsicube::addWorkCommand('your-unique-key', 'your-module:work');
    }
}
```
