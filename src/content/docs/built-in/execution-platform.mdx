import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The **Execution Platform** enables modules to define and execute **Activities** and **Workflows** with full state tracking, automatic retries, and integration with external systems.

## Core Concepts

* **Activities** — Atomic operations that can run independently or as part of a Workflow.
* **Workflows** — Orchestrated sequences of Activities, with complete state and history tracking.

## Features

* Extendable by any module
* Automatic execution tracking and logging
* Database-backed history of all runs
* Built-in error handling and retry strategies
* Optional **InputSchema** and **OutputSchema** for each Activity or Workflow

## Installation

<Steps>
1. ### Install the Package
    <Aside type="tip">
    If you are using `epsicube/framework`, this module is included by default, skip this step.
    </Aside>
    ```bash
    composer require epsicube/module-execution-platform
    ```

2. ### Enable the Module

   ```bash
   php artisan modules:enable core::execution-platform
   ```

3. ### Clear Cached Configuration

   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   ```

</Steps>

## Extending the Execution Platform

Modules can inject custom Activities and Workflows through **[Integrations](/writing-module/declare-integrations/)**.
When the Execution Platform is active, you can extend its registries:

```php
\EpsicubeModules\ExecutionPlatform\Facades\Activities::register(...);
\EpsicubeModules\ExecutionPlatform\Facades\Workflows::register(...);
```

### Example: Register a Custom Activity and Workflow

```php
use EpsicubeModules\ExecutionPlatform\Facades\Activities;
use EpsicubeModules\ExecutionPlatform\Facades\Workflows;

class MailModule extends ServiceProvider implements HasIntegrations, Module
{
    public function integrations(): Integrations
    {
        return Integrations::make()
            ->forModule('core::execution-platform', function () {
                Activities::register(SendMailActivity::make());
                Workflows::register(SendMailWorkflow::make());
            });
    }
}
```

## Future Vision & Capabilities

The Execution Platform provides a flexible orchestration layer that supports both current and planned functionality:

* Expose all **Activities**, **Tasks**, and **Workflows** via an auto-generated **MCP Server**
* Trigger Activities programmatically or via graphical tools like **N8N**
* Dispatch Workflows across multiple workers using external engines such as **Temporal.io**
* Planned workflow execution drivers:

  * **Temporal.io** — Distributed orchestration for complex workflows
  * **Laravel Workflow** — Laravel-native engine
  * **Sync driver** — Simple synchronous execution for lightweight tasks

This unified approach allows modules to integrate seamlessly, track executions, and scale with both native and external orchestration tools.
