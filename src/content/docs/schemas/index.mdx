The **Schema** is a feature of Epsicube, providing a robust system to define **structured, validated, and reusable data configurations**.

It is fully integrated into the framework and can be leveraged anywhere in your application—whether for configuration, forms, options, or any structured data.

Using Schema, you can:

- Declare fields with specific types, default values, and constraints.
- Handle complex or nested data structures in a clean and maintainable way.
- Validate and transform data consistently across multiple contexts:
    - Laravel Validation Rules
    - FilamentPHP Schema (Forms or Infolists)
    - JSON Schema
    - CLI prompts (via Laravel Prompts)


<Aside title="Information">
    The Schema is a feature that can be used in any context—configuration, options, forms, API data structures, or custom workflows.
</Aside>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
1. ### Install the package

    <Aside type="tip">
    If you are using `epsicube/framework`, the Schema system is included by default and this step can be skipped.
    </Aside>

    ```bash
    composer require epsicube/schemas
    ```

2. ### Define your first schema

    Schemas are defined using the [`Epsicube\Schemas\Schema`](https://github.com/epsicube/framework/blob/main/packages/Schemas/Schema.php) class and its field definitions..
    See **[Defining Schemas](/schemas/defining-schemas)** for step-by-step instructions.

3. ### Start using schemas

    Once defined, schemas can be used to validate, transform, and structure data anywhere in your application.
