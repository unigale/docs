**Epsicube** is a modular application framework built on top of Laravel.
It provides a robust architecture for building extensible systems composed of isolated modules, shared integrations, and
configurable execution pipelines.

## Global Requirements

Before installing Epsicube, ensure your environment meets these core requirements:

- **PHP 8.4+**
- **Composer**
- **PHP Extensions**:
    - `intl`: Required for advanced localization and string handling.
    - `pcntl`: Required for the **Epsicube Worker** to manage process signals and multi-processing.

## Create a New Application

The fastest way to start with Epsicube is to use the official Laravel installer with the Epsicube starter kit. This method handles all boilerplate configuration for you.

<Steps>
1. ### Install Laravel Installer
    If you haven't already, install the Laravel installer globally:
    ```bash
    composer global require laravel/installer
    ```

2. ### Scaffold with Epsicube
    Create a new project using the `--using` flag:
    ```bash
    laravel new my-modular-app --using=epsicube/epsicube
    ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  This command scaffolds a fresh Laravel application pre-configured with the `EpsicubeApplication` container and a modular directory structure.

### Running with Docker (Starter Kit only)

If you are using the starter kit, a `docker-compose.yml` is provided to quickly lift your development environment.

<Steps>
1. ### Start the containers
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

2. ### Run migrations
    Since the database is isolated within the container, run the migrations inside the `dev` service:
    ```bash
    docker compose exec dev php artisan migrate
    ```

3. ### Access the container shell
    To run manual commands or explore the environment, you can open a bash session:
    ```bash
    docker compose exec dev bash
    ```
</Steps>

## Manual Installation (Into Existing App)

To integrate Epsicube into an already existing Laravel project, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites for Existing Apps
- **Laravel 12.x**: Your application must be running on the latest stable version of Laravel.

<Steps>
1. ### Install the framework

    Install Epsicube via Composer:

    ```bash
    composer require epsicube/framework
    ```

2. ### Replace the application class

    Epsicube uses its own application container, `EpsicubeApplication`.
    Update your `bootstrap/app.php` to use the Epsicube foundation:

    ```php
    use Epsicube\Foundation\EpsicubeApplication;

    return EpsicubeApplication::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
        ->withRouting()
        ->withMiddleware()
        ->withExceptions()
        ->create();
    ```

3. ### Run migrations

    Epsicube requires a few database tables to manage the **Options Store** and **Module Registry**.
    Apply the migrations:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
</Steps>

## Configure the Worker

Epsicube relies on its own worker system (`epsicube:work`) to supervise long-running processes (queues, schedulers, custom loops).

**This step is required for both manual installations and starter kit installations (unless you are running the worker via the provided Docker containers).**

Refer to the **[Production Setup](/usage/manage-processes/#setup-for-production)** for supervisor configuration.

## Verify Installation

Once installed, you can verify that Epsicube is correctly integrated into your Laravel environment. Epsicube injects its metadata directly into the Laravel `about` command.

Run the following command to check your Epsicube version and core status:

```bash
php artisan about --only Epsicube

```

You should see an output similar to this:

| Epsicube |       |
|----------|-------|
| Version  | 1.0.x |
