**Epsicube** is a modular application framework built on top of Laravel.
It provides a robust architecture for building extensible systems composed of isolated modules, shared integrations, and
configurable execution pipelines.

Epsicube enhances Laravel's foundation without altering its philosophy, offering additional capabilities such as module
lifecycle management, multi-core orchestration, workflow execution, and centralized configuration.


## Requirements

Epsicube follows the requirements of your Laravel version and does not introduce additional PHP extension dependencies.

Ensure your environment meets the following:

- PHP version required by your Laravel installation
- Composer
- A working Laravel application (supported version: **Laravel 12.x**)

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
1. ### Install the framework

    Install Epsicube via Composer:

    ```bash
    composer require epsicube/framework
    ```

2. ### Replace the application class

    Epsicube uses its own application container, `EpsicubeApplication`.
    Update your `bootstrap/app.php` accordingly:

    ```php
    use Epsicube\Foundation\EpsicubeApplication;

    return EpsicubeApplication::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
        ->withRouting()
        ->withMiddleware()
        ->withExceptions()
        ->create();
    ```

3. ### Run migrations

    Epsicube automatically provides additional migrations required for its internal systems.
    Apply all pending migrations:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

4. ### Configure long-running tasks

    Epsicube provides its own unified worker system through the `epsicube:work` command.
    This worker supervises long-running processes defined by modules (e.g., schedulers, queues).

    Refer to the section **[Configure worker for production](/usage/manage-processes/#setup-for-production)** for detailed instructions.
