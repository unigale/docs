**Epsicube** is a modular application framework built on top of Laravel.
It provides a robust architecture for building extensible systems composed of isolated modules, shared integrations, and configurable execution pipelines.

## Global Requirements

Before installing Epsicube, ensure your environment meets these core requirements:

- **PHP 8.4+**
- **Composer**
- **PHP Extensions**:
    - `intl`: Required for advanced localization and string handling.
    - `pcntl`: Required for the **Epsicube Worker** to manage process signals.

## Installation Guide

Choose the method that best fits your project needs:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="New App (Starter Kit)">

    The fastest way to start. This uses the official Laravel installer to scaffold a project pre-configured with Epsicube.

    <Steps>
    1. ### Install Laravel Installer
        If you haven't already, install the installer globally:
        ```bash
        composer global require laravel/installer
        ```

    2. ### Scaffold Project
        Create a new project using the `--using` flag to pull the Epsicube starter kit:
        ```bash
        laravel new my-modular-app --using=epsicube/epsicube
        ```

    3. ### Run with Docker (Optional)
        The starter kit includes a `docker-compose.yml`. To lift your environment:
        ```bash
        # Start containers
        docker compose up -d

        # Run migrations inside the container
        docker compose exec epsicube php artisan migrate

        # Access the container shell
        docker compose exec epsicube bash
        ```
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Existing Application">

    Follow these steps to integrate Epsicube into an existing Laravel 12.x project.

    <Steps>
    1. ### Install via Composer
        Add the framework to your dependencies:
        ```bash
        composer require epsicube/framework
        ```

    2. ### Replace Application Class
        Epsicube uses its own container, `EpsicubeApplication`.
        Update your `bootstrap/app.php` file:

        ```php
        use Epsicube\Foundation\EpsicubeApplication;

        return EpsicubeApplication::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
            ->withRouting()
            ->withMiddleware()
            ->withExceptions()
            ->create();
        ```

    3. ### Run Migrations
        Epsicube requires internal tables to manage the module registry and options store:
        ```bash
        php artisan migrate
        ```
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Worker Configuration

Epsicube relies on its own worker system (`epsicube:work`) to supervise long-running processes (queues, schedulers, custom loops).

**This step is required for both installation methods** (unless you are using Docker, where the worker is already pre-configured in the services).

Refer to the **[Production Setup](/usage/manage-processes/#setup-for-production)** for detailed instructions on using Supervisor.

## Verify Installation

Epsicube injects its metadata directly into the native Laravel `about` command. Run the following to ensure everything is operational:

```bash
php artisan about --only Epsicube

```

You should see an output similar to this:

| Epsicube |       |
|----------|-------|
| Version  | 1.0.x |
